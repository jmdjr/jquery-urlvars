# jquery-urlvars
Simple collection of jquery extensions which simplifies "hashing" back and forth between strings.

always had problems pulling url vars into javascript and parsing them simply. this collection of jquery extensions will convert a string of url variables into a hash dictionary
for simple reference. can take a similar hash and convert into a url variable list as well. may have many different uses
